# Zanett's blog

My name is Marco, and I'm a computer engineer currently enrolled for a master's at the university of Padua. From now on, I'm planning on releasing some posts here in my blog talking about my field and my passion: computer engineering! Mostly, I will post about my knowledge in the Information technology field and some of my projects on Artificial Intelligence and data science. I'm blogging because I think it's going to help me polish my knowledge while on the same time enable me to teach people something new. As once Eintein said, "you didn't really undersood something unless you can explain it to your grandmother". I hope you'll have a good time reading, and hopefully you will also learn something useful. May the force be with you.
