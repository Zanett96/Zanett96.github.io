> To build a city where it is impossible to build a city is madness in itself, but to build there one of the most elegant and grandest of cities is the madness of genius. -
> Alexander Herzen


Venice has for centuries been one of the most unique and fascinating cities in the world. I've lived near Venice for 24 years now, and I've been there countless times, and with each time I fell in love with the city all over again. 

The citzen and the turists needs to however deal with the struggle of the High Water phenomenon. 
>"High Water occurs when certain events coincide, such as:
1. A very high tide (usually during a full or new moon).
2. Low atmospheric pressure.
3. A scirocco wind blowing up the narrow, shallow Adriatic Sea, which forces water into the Venetian Lagoon.
The phenomenon is most likely to take place between late September and April, and especially in the months of November, December, and October, in that order. However, thanks to global warming, it now can occur at any time of year.
