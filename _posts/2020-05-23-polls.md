I always found entertaining doing polls on Twitter to check the percentage of peoples who thinks like me on specific topics. 
Doing random polls on internet is fun and all, but we should always be wary of conducting an online poll and reporting the results on
an official work, especially when the writer has no basics of statistic whatsoever.

I saw many contemporaries from different specializations (be it psicology or marketing) conducting polls on social network and reporting 
the results on their thesis taking what they obtained for granted.
