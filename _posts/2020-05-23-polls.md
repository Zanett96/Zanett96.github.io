I always found entertaining doing polls on Twitter to check the percentage of peoples who thinks like me on certain topics, like how many hours you spend on Instagram or what film you prefer. Doing random polls on internet is fun and all, but we should always be wary of conducting an online poll and reporting the results on an official work, especially when the writer has no basics of statistic whatsoever.

I saw many contemporaries from different specializations (like psicology or marketing) conducting polls on social network and reporting 
the results on their thesis, taking what they obtained for absolute truth. But in reality, polls are hard. Statisticians spend a lot of their time designing efficient polls, which must be structured in an efficient way to minimize the intrinsic bias in the questions and ensuring we pick a good sample of the population. 

## How can we pick a good sample?

We can imagine the total population as the entire set of people who are eligible for answering the poll. Since it is generally impossible to study the full population, we can consider samples which we'll then use to draw our conclusion over the entire population. Imaine a sample of the population as a subset of the total population with a certain size *n*. The larger *n*, the more information we will be able to gather. However, keep in mind that a large size don't necessarily means that the information we gather is going to be any better. 

The biggest problem with online polls is whitout a doubt the fact that we cannot ensure that our sample population will be representative. A general and simple way to ensure that the sample is more representative is by doing the sampling randomly from the entire population. This way we ensure that our data won't be skewed and we'll obtain a better accuracy. If the random sampling is doing correctly, even small samples can show low sampling error. To achieve their precise results, statistician rely on the [Central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem). To put it simply, given a sufficient number of sample of the same size, we'll obtain a similar distribution to the one of the entire population. 

## The weak points of online polls

After explaining this, it should be more clear why using polls conducted online is a bad idea. Let's try to summarize the main weak points of this procedure:

1. The sampling is not randomized. Since our possibilities are limited, we'll rely on easier and cheaper methods of obtaining our informations, like using [EasyPolls](https://www.easypolls.net/) or asking relatives to answer our question. This lead to extremely skewed data, which are not able to capture the entire population at all. For example, if you share your polls on social network, you'll reach only a specific demographic which usually shares the same ideas or location as you. This will be nowhere near the entire population distribution we are trying to approximate.  

2. Since online polls are self-selected, there exists the risk of having only people interested in the topic to fill our poll. This implies more skewiness in our data.

3. The fact that it's easy to modify the data, people (or even you) might use this as a way of letting the results lean towards certains

Since we are considering small scales polls, I will leave out the possibility of bots manipulation.
