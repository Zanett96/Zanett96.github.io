I always found entertaining doing polls on Twitter to check the percentage of peoples who thinks like me on certain topics. Doing random polls on internet is fun and all, but we should always be wary of conducting an online poll and reporting the results on an official work, especially when the writer has no basics of statistic whatsoever.

I saw many contemporaries from different specializations (like psicology or marketing) conducting polls on social network and reporting 
the results on their thesis, taking what they obtained for absolute truth. But in reality, polls are hard. Statisticians spend a lot of their time designing efficient polls which has to be structured in an efficient way to minimize the intrinsic bias in the questions and ensuring we analyze a good sample of the population.
