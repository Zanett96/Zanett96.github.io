I always found entertaining doing polls on Twitter to check the percentage of peoples who thinks like me on certain topics, like how many hours you spend on Instagram or what film you prefer. Doing random polls on internet is fun and all, but we should always be wary of conducting an online poll and reporting the results on an official work, especially when the writer has no basics of statistic whatsoever.

I saw many contemporaries from different specializations (like psicology or marketing) conducting polls on social network and reporting 
the results on their thesis, taking what they obtained for absolute truth. But in reality, polls are hard. Statisticians spend a lot of their time designing efficient polls, which must be structured in an efficient way to minimize the intrinsic bias in the questions and ensuring we pick a good sample of the population. 

## Population

We can imagine the total population as the entire set of people who are eligible for answering the poll. Since it is generally impossible to study the full population, we can consider samples which we'll then use to draw our conclusion over the entire population. Image a sample of the population as a subset of the total population with a certain size *n*. The larger *n*, the more information we will be able to gather. However, keep in mind that large *n* don't necessarily means that the information we gather is going to be any better. The biggest problem with online polls is whitout a doubt the fact that we cannot enure that our sample population will be representative. A general and simple way to ensure that the sample is more representative is by doing the sampling randomly. This way we ensure that our data won't be and we'll obtain a better accuracy. If the random sampling is doing correctly, even small samples can show low sampling error.
